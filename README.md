1. Save only a set of configured fields into the DB from an incoming JSON. The fields that are to be saved are configurable on the fly in the properties file. Uses H2 DB and Jackson library.
2. Experimenting with After-Burner module in Jackson framework for JSON to POJO and POJO to JSON. Profiling the after-burner.
